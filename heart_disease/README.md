## Attribute Information
### Only 14 attributes used:
**age** : age of patient

**sex** : male or female

**(cp) chest pain type (4 values)** : 

- Value 0: typical angina
- Value 1: atypical angina
- Value 2: non-anginal pain
- Value 3: asymptomatic

**(trestbps) resting blood pressure** : 

- Normal: Systolic blood pressure less than 120 mmHg and diastolic blood pressure less than 80 mmHg.
- Prehypertension: Systolic blood pressure 120-139 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 80-89 mmHg.
- Stage 1 hypertension: Systolic blood pressure 140-159 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 90-99 mmHg.
- Stage 2 hypertension: Systolic blood pressure 160 mmHg or higher or diastolic blood pressure 100 mmHg or higher.

**(chol) serum cholestoral in mg/dl** :

Serum cholesterol is measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The normal range for serum cholesterol is:

- Less than 200mg/dL	Desirable
- 200-239 mg/dL	Borderline high
- 240mg/dL and above	High

**(fbs) fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl** : Considered prediabetes

**(restecg)resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)**: 

a test that records the electrical activity of your heart while you are at rest. It can be used to detect heart problems, such as arrhythmias (irregular heartbeats), heart muscle damage, and heart attack.

- Value 0: normal
- Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
- Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

**(thalach) maximum heart rate achieved** : MHR = 220 - age

**(exang) exercise induced angina** : 

exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

Exercise-induced angina is *chest pain* or discomfort that occurs when you exercise or do other activities that increase your heart rate.

**(oldpeak) ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest** :

ST depression induced by exercise is a common electrocardiographic (ECG) finding that can be seen in people with coronary artery disease (CAD). It occurs when the heart muscle does not receive enough oxygen during exercise. This can be caused by a narrowing of the coronary arteries, which reduces blood flow to the heart.

**(slope) the slope of the peak exercise ST segment** : 


The slope of the peak exercise ST segment is a measure of the heart's response to exercise. A normal slope is upsloping, meaning that the ST segment rises as the heart rate increases. A downsloping or horizontal slope is abnormal and may be a sign of coronary artery disease (CAD)

- Value 0: upsloping
- Value 1: flat
- Value 2: downsloping

**(ca) number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy**: 
number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

**(thal)**: 0 = normal; 1 = fixed defect; 2 = reversable defect

**target**: 1 or 0
