## Welcome to my data analysis playground
Welcome to my Data Analysis Playground Repository! This repository serves as a platform for me to explore various datasets and perform data analysis using Jupyter Notebook. Here, I learn from diverse data resources, including Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, government open data, and more, to enhance my skills as a data analyst.
## Main tools
In this repository, I engage in data exploration, visualization, and machine learning tasks. My primary tool for analysis is Jupyter Notebook, which enables me to work interactively with the data and share my insights effectively.
## Libraries
In this repository, I leverage the power of various Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and machine learning. Some of the key libraries include:

- pandas: A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Used for numerical computations on arrays and matrices.
- matplotlib: A versatile library for creating visualizations in Python.
- scikit-learn: Provides a range of machine learning algorithms and tools.
